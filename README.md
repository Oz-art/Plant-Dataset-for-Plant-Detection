# Plant-Dataset-for-Plant-Detection
This image was downloaded from google image. When i download the image, the size is less than 600px, so its not compatible with the tensorflow framework that have the minimum image size is 600px. So i resize the image using the following matlab code, you can download the code [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hf4xdeg00bpjmk4/multiple_images_resizer.m?dl=0). This dataset contain of the image file and the xml file, where the xml file is the label of the related image. The image was devided into 3 objects (green lettuce, red lettuce, and cabbage) for now, i will update it with the other plant image and the label as soon as possible. Hope it will be usefull for your research.
